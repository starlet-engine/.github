# Starlet Engine

**Starlet Engine** is a long-term personal exploration of C++ engine architecture, graphics systems, and developer tooling. It prioritizes small, composable libraries over monolithic designs, with experimentation as a core principle.

The organization houses focused modules for rendering, scene management, math, serialization, and input, alongside engine samples, experimental sandboxes, and build automation. Everything is designed around mono-repo development via `starlet-setup`.


This is not intended to be a publicly released framework, production engine, or drop-in library. It's an experimental lab for C++ programming.
