# Starlet Engine Hub

A modular C++ engine ecosystem focused on graphics and tooling.

## Quick Start

- **Start a project** -> [`starter`](https://github.com/starlet-engine/starter) Project template wired to the engine and libraries.
- **See examples** -> [`samples`](https://github.com/starlet-engine/samples) Example scenes and experiments demonstrating rendering, scenes, and input.
- **Mono-repo development** -> [`starlet-setup`](https://github.com/starlet-engine/starlet-setup) Tooling for cloning, configuring, and building Starlet projects

## Experiments
- **[noise-sandbox](https://github.com/starlet-engine/noise-sandbox)** — Experimental noise algorithms
- **[image-sandbox](https://github.com/starlet-engine/image-sandbox)** — Image loading and format experiments

## Core Libraries
- **[engine](https://github.com/starlet-engine/engine)** — Core engine and orchestration layer
- **[graphics](https://github.com/starlet-engine/graphics)** — Rendering, shaders, meshes, and textures
- **[controls](https://github.com/starlet-engine/controls)** — Input and control handling
- **[scene](https://github.com/starlet-engine/scene)** — ECS-based scene management
- **[math](https://github.com/starlet-engine/math)** — Lightweight header-only math utilities
- **[logger](https://github.com/starlet-engine/logger)** — Logging tooling
- **[serializer](https://github.com/starlet-engine/serializer)** — File and data serialization utilities
- **[testing](https://github.com/starlet-engine/testing)** — Future cross-library unit and integration testing

## Tooling
- **[starlet-setup](https://github.com/starlet-engine/starlet-setup)** — Python utility for cloning, configuring, and building Starlet projects for mono-repo development
- **[development](https://github.com/starlet-engine/development)** — Archived development hub (superseded by starlet-setup)
- **[.github](https://github.com/starlet-engine/.github)** — Organization-level configuration and documentation

Starlet is a long-term personal project used to explore engine design, graphics systems, and software architecture. It is not intended for public release.
